###I won once

1. 5 of spades and 6 / 5 of clubs and 6

2. Yes, the three cards must be a J, Q and K because non-face cards are removed in pairs. Therefore, when removed, non-face cards leave the amount of cards undealt either even or odd, depending upon what it was beforehand. Also, the only way to remove a face card is by removing a J, Q and K all at the same time. For any of the last three cards to be a face cards, they must all be a J, Q and K. If they aren't, then a total of 12 face cards would be removed from the deck, meaning there is an even amount of cards in the deck, so therefore there could never be exactly three left over.

3. No, this game involves no strategy, because it is completely reliant upon the initial cards in play and what replaces the cards you remove. There is no way to know what card will replace the cards that are removed, so there is no way to strategize.
