1. A deck is an object containing a list of card objects. A deck is multiple cards.
2. 6
3.
```
ranks = ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "10", "10", "10", "11"]
suits = ["spades", "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs"]
pointValues = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11]
```
4. Yes, the order of the three elements matters, because the middle element should always be `suits`, for a card is created of each `rank` and `pointValue` for each `suit`. The `rank` and `pointValue` could be switched.
